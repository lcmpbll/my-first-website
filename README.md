## Description

###This application will allow me to practice building websites while applying different css styling elements. In my first website I practice using different elements such as h1, as well as basic html practice. In index.html I practice inserting images, and in my-favorite-place.html I use the opportunity to describe some of my favorite places while practicing css styling an html page.

* Navigate to your desktop in the terminal. 
* $ git clone 
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_
