###This application will allow me to practice building websites while applying different css styling elements. In my first website I practice using different elements such as h1, as well as basic html practice. In index.html I practice inserting images, and in my-favorite-place.html I use the opportunity to describe some of my favorite places while practicing css styling an html page.
